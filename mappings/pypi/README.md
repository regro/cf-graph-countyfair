The files in this prefix are generated by the PyPi name mepper that is run as part of the conda-forge bot.

If there are missing mappings that are not autodiscovered those can either be fixed by 

1. Adjusting the conda-forge recipe to pull from PyPI (if it isn't already)
2. Issueing a PR to adjust the static name mapping found here https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/blob/master/conda_forge_tick/pypi_name_mapping_static.yaml
