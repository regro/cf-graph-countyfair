There are numerous\nmature C++ array libraries that support a wide variety of array operations, but\nbecause they also use expression templates to optimize array expressions, they\ndo not work efficiently with Adept. The solution provided in version 2 of\nAdept is to use a single expression-template framework that incorporates both\narray and automatic-differentiation capabilities at a low level, thus enabling\nefficient differentiation of array expressions. Arrays of up to 7 dimensions are\nsupported along with matrix multiplication and basic linear algebra operations.\nOf course, the library also works well with passive arrays (those that do not\nneed to be differentiated).\n",
