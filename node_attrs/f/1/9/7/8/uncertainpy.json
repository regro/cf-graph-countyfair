Examples of features in neuroscience can be spike timing and the action potential shape.\n\nUncertainpy is tailored towards neuroscience models, and comes with several common neuroscience models and features\nbuilt in, but new models and features can easily be implemented. It should be noted that while Uncertainpy is tailored\ntowards neuroscience, the implemented methods are general, and Uncertainpy can be used for many other types of models\nand features within other fields.\n",
