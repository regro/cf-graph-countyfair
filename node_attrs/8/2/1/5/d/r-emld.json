Doing so creates a list-based representation of 'EML' in R, so that 'EML' data can easily be manipulated using standard 'R' tools. This makes this package an effective backend for other 'R'-based tools  working with 'EML.' By abstracting away the complexity of 'XML' Schema, developers can build around native 'R' list objects and not have to worry about satisfying many of the additional constraints of set by the schema (such as element ordering, which is handled automatically). Additionally, the 'JSON-LD'  representation enables the use of developer-friendly 'JSON' parsing and serialization that may facilitate the use of 'EML' in contexts outside of 'R,' as well as the informatics-friendly serializations such as 'RDF' and 'SPARQL' queries."
