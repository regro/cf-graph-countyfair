Every key and value is serial bytes with\n     variable length. Both binary data and character string can be used as\n     a key and a value. There is neither concept of data tables nor data\n     types. Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or fixed-length\n     array.\n\n     Tokyo Cabinet is developed as the successor of GDBM and QDBM on the\n     following purposes. They are achieved and Tokyo Cabinet replaces\n     conventional DBM products.\n\n       improves space efficiency : smaller size of database file.\n       improves time efficiency : faster processing speed.\n       improves parallelism : higher performance in multi-thread environment.\n       improves usability : simplified API.\n       improves robustness : database file is not corrupted even under catastrophic situation.\n       supports 64-bit architecture : enormous memory space and database file are available.\n\n     Tokyo Cabinet is written in the C language, and provided as API of\n     C, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Lua. Tokyo Cabinet is available on platforms\n     which have API conforming to C99 and POSIX. Tokyo Cabinet is a\n     free software licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nextra:\n  recipe-maintainers:\n    - aseyboldt\n    - danielnachun\n",
