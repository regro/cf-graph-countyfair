See  Clyde, Ghosh and Littman (2010) <DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.09049> for  details on the sampling algorithms. Uniform priors over all models or beta-binomial prior distributions on model size are allowed, and for large p truncated priors on the model space may be used to enforce sampling models that are full rank. The user may force variables to always be included in addition to imposing constraints that higher order interactions are included only if their parents are included in the model.
