LiDAR\npoint clouds can be interrogated (LidarInfo, LidarHistogram), segmented, tiled and joined,\nanalyized for outliers, interpolated to rasters (DEMs, intensity images), and ground-points can be\nclassified or filtered.

WhiteboxTools can be\n    used to perform common geographical information systems (GIS) analysis operations, such as\n    cost-distance analysis, distance buffering, and raster reclassification. Remote sensing and image\n    processing tasks include image enhancement (e.g. panchromatic sharpening, contrast adjustments),\n    image mosaicing, numerous filtering operations, simple classification (k-means), and common image\n    transformations. WhiteboxTools also contains advanced tooling for spatial hydrological analysis\n    (e.g. flow-accumulation, watershed delineation, stream network analysis, sink removal), terrain\n    analysis (e.g. common terrain indices such as slope, curvatures, wetness index, hillshading;\n    hypsometric analysis; multi-scale topographic position analysis), and LiDAR data processing. LiDAR\n    point clouds can be interrogated (LidarInfo, LidarHistogram), segmented, tiled and joined,\n    analyized for outliers, interpolated to rasters (DEMs, intensity images), and ground-points can be\n    classified or filtered. WhiteboxTools is not a cartographic or spatial data visualization package;\n    instead it is meant to serve as an analytical backend for other data visualization software,\n    mainly GIS.\n\nextra:\n  recipe-maintainers:\n    - dharhas\n    - sdc50\n    - hobu\n",
