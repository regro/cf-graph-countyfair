      "description": "City2Graph is a Python library for converting datasets of geospatial relations into\ngraphs. It is designed to facilitate graph data analytics in particular for urban\nstudies and spatial analysis. It supports PyTorch Geometric to enable graph\nrepresentation learning, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).\n\nKey features include:\n- Construct graphs from morphological datasets (buildings, streets, land use)\n- Construct graphs from transportation datasets (public transport networks)\n- Construct graphs from contiguity datasets (land use, land cover, administrative boundaries)\n- Construct graphs from mobility datasets (bike-sharing, migration, pedestrian flows)\n- Convert geospatial data into tensors for graph representation learning\n- Support for various proximity methods (KNN, Waxman, fixed radius)\n- Integration with PyTorch Geometric's Data and HeteroData formats\n\nThe library enables urban researchers and data scientists to transform complex\ngeospatial relationships into graph structures suitable for network analysis\nand machine learning applications.\n",
