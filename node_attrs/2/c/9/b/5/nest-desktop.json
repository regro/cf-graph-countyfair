      "description": "NEST Desktop is a web-based application which provides a graphical user interface for NEST Simulator. With this\neasy-to-use tool, users can interactively construct neuronal networks and explore network dynamics. Advanced users\noften choose NEST Simulator: a prominent tool for spiking neuronal networks to measure network dynamics. However,\nprogramming knowledge is required to write code for this tool. NEST Desktop bypasses this requirement, but still\nteaches users how to construct and explore neuronal networks. A textual script is generated from the constructed\nnetworks and sent to NEST Simulator; the network activity is then visualized in a graph or table. It is a useful\nteaching tool, since the network graphs and network activity visualizations can be exported to files that users can\nimplement for their course protocol.\n",
