There is\nneither concept of data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.\n\nKyoto Cabinet runs very fast. For example, elapsed time to store one million records is 0.9 seconds for hash\ndatabase, and 1.1 seconds for B+ tree database. Moreover, the size of database is very small. For example,\noverhead for a record is 16 bytes for hash database, and 4 bytes for B+ tree database. Furthermore, scalability of\nKyoto Cabinet is great.
