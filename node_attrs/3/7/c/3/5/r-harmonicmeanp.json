It is more stringent than controlling the false discovery rate, and possesses theoretical robustness to positive correlations between tests and unequal weights. It is a multi-level test in the sense that a superset of one or more significant tests is certain to be significant and conversely when the superset is non-significant, the constituent tests are certain to be non-significant.
