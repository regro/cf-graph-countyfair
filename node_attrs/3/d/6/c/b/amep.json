      "description": "The Active Matter Evaluation Package (AMEP) is a powerful tool for analyzing\nsimulation data of active matter systems. It provides a unified framework for\nhandling both particle-based and continuum simulation data. AMEP provides a\nhuge variety of analysis methods for both data types that allow to evaluate\nvarious dynamic and static observables based on the trajectories of the particles\nor the time evolution of continuum fields. For fast and efficient data handling,\nAMEP provides a unified framework for loading and storing simulation data and\nanalysis results in a compressed, HDF5-based data format. AMEP is written purely\nin Python and uses powerful libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and\nscikit-image commonly used in computational physics. Therefore, understanding,\nmodifying, and building up on the provided framework is comparatively easy. All\nevaluation functions are optimized to run efficiently on HPC (High Performance\nComputing) hardware to provide fast computations. To plot and visualize simulation\ndata and analysis results, AMEP provides an optimized plotting framework based on\nthe Matplotlib Python library, which allows to easily plot and animate particles,\nfields, and lines. Compared to other analysis libraries, the huge variety of analysis\nmethods combined with the possibility to handle both most common data types used in\nsoft-matter physics and in active-matter physics in particular, enables the\nanalysis of a much broader class of simulation data including not only classical\nmolecular-dynamics or Brownian-dynamics simulations but also any kind of numerical\nsolutions of partial differential equations.\n",
