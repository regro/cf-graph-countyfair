      "description": "You can use NEST either as a for the interpreted programming language Python (PyNEST) or as a stand alone\napplication (nest). PyNEST provides a set of commands to the Python interpreter which give you access to NEST's\nsimulation kernel. With these commands, you describe and run your network simulation. You can also complement\nPyNEST with PyNN, a simulator-independent set of Python commands to formulate and run neural simulations. While\nyou define your simulations in Python, the actual simulation is executed within NEST's highly optimized\nsimulation kernel which is written in C++. A NEST simulation tries to follow the logic of an\nelectrophysiological experiment that takes place inside a computer with the difference, that the neural system\nto be investigated must be defined by the experimenter. The neural system is defined by a possibly large number\nof neurons and their connections. In a NEST network, different neuron and synapse models can coexist. Any two\nneurons can have multiple connections with different properties. Thus, the connectivity can in general not\nbe described by a weight or connectivity matrix but rather as an adjacency list. To manipulate or observe the\nnetwork dynamics, the experimenter can define so-called devices which represent the various instruments (for\nmeasuring and stimulation) found in an experiment. These devices write their data either to memory or to file.\nNEST is extensible and new models for neurons, synapses, and devices can be added.

      "description": "You can use NEST either as a for the interpreted programming language Python (PyNEST) or as a stand alone\napplication (nest). PyNEST provides a set of commands to the Python interpreter which give you access to NEST's\nsimulation kernel. With these commands, you describe and run your network simulation. You can also complement\nPyNEST with PyNN, a simulator-independent set of Python commands to formulate and run neural simulations. While\nyou define your simulations in Python, the actual simulation is executed within NEST's highly optimized\nsimulation kernel which is written in C++. A NEST simulation tries to follow the logic of an\nelectrophysiological experiment that takes place inside a computer with the difference, that the neural system\nto be investigated must be defined by the experimenter. The neural system is defined by a possibly large number\nof neurons and their connections. In a NEST network, different neuron and synapse models can coexist. Any two\nneurons can have multiple connections with different properties. Thus, the connectivity can in general not\nbe described by a weight or connectivity matrix but rather as an adjacency list. To manipulate or observe the\nnetwork dynamics, the experimenter can define so-called devices which represent the various instruments (for\nmeasuring and stimulation) found in an experiment. These devices write their data either to memory or to file.\nNEST is extensible and new models for neurons, synapses, and devices can be added. To get started with NEST,\nplease see the documentation page <https://nest-simulator.org/documentation/>.\n",
