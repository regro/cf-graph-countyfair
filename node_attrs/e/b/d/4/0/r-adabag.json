In addition, the ensembles can be pruned using the option 'newmfinal' in the predict.bagging() and predict.boosting() functions and the posterior probability of each class for observations can be obtained. Version 3.1 modifies the relative importance measure to take into account the gain of the Gini index given by a variable in each tree and the weights of these trees. Version 4.0 includes the margin-based ordered aggregation for Bagging pruning (Guo and Boukir, 2013) and a function to auto prune the 'rpart' tree. Moreover, three new plots are also available importanceplot(), plot.errorevol() and plot.margins(). Version 4.1 allows to predict on unlabeled data. Version 4.2 includes the parallel computation option for some of the functions."
