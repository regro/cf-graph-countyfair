This package integrates\nnicely with the R-package 'rgl' to render the meshes processed by 'Rvcg'.\nThe Visualization and Computer Graphics Library (VCG for short) is an open\nsource portable C++ templated library for manipulation, processing and\ndisplaying with OpenGL of triangle and tetrahedral meshes. The library,\ncomposed by more than 100k lines of code, is released under the GPL\nlicense, and it is the base of most of the software tools of the Visual\nComputing Lab of the Italian National Research Council Institute ISTI\n<http://vcg.isti.cnr.it>, like 'metro' and 'MeshLab'. The 'VCGLIB' source\nis pulled from trunk <https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/vcglib>\nand patched to work with options determined by the configure script as\nwell as to work with the header files included by 'RcppEigen'.\n"
