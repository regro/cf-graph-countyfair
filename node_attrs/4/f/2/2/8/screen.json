Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC\n    VT100 terminal and, in addition, several control functions from\n    the ANSI X3.64 (ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g.,\n    insert/delete line and support for multiple character sets). There\n    is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a\n    copy-and-paste mechanism that allows the user to move text regions\n    between windows. When screen is called, it creates a single window\n    with a shell in it (or the specified command) and then gets out of\n    your way so that you can use the program as you normally\n    would. Then, at any time, you can create new (full-screen) windows\n    with other programs in them (including more shells), kill the\n    current window, view a list of the active windows, turn output\n    logging on and off, copy text between windows, view the scrollback\n    history, switch between windows, etc. All windows run their\n    programs completely independent of each other. Programs continue\n    to run when their window is currently not visible and even when\n    the whole screen session is detached from the users terminal.\n    simplejson is a simple, fast, complete, correct and extensible\n    JSON <https://json.org> encoder and decoder for Python 2.5+ and\n    Python 3.3+. It is pure Python code with no dependencies, but\n    includes an optional C extension for a serious speed boost.\n  doc_url: https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html\n  dev_url: https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=screen\n\nextra:\n  recipe-maintainers:\n    - notestaff\n",
