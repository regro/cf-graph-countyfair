There are tradeoffs, and the functionality supported is slightly different. Both are built by default. It is up to the application linking to hidapi to choose the backend at link time by linking to either libhidapi-libusb or libhidapi-hidraw.\nNote that you will need to install an udev rule file with your application for unprivileged users to be able to access HID devices with hidapi. Refer to the 69-hid.rules file in the udev directory for an example.\n\n\nThis back-end uses the hidraw interface in the Linux kernel, and supports both USB and Bluetooth HID devices.
