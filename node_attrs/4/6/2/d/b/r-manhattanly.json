Hover the mouse pointer over a point to show details or drag a rectangle to zoom. A manhattan plot is a popular graphical method for visualizing results from high-dimensional data analysis such as a (epi)genome wide association study (GWAS or EWAS), in which p-values, Z-scores, test statistics are plotted on a scatter plot against their genomic position. Manhattan plots are used for visualizing potential regions of interest in the genome that are associated with a phenotype. Interactive manhattan plots allow the inspection of specific value (e.g. rs number or gene name) by hovering the mouse over a cell, as well as zooming into a region of the genome (e.g. a chromosome) by dragging a rectangle around the relevant area. This work is based on the 'qqman' package and the 'plotly.js' engine. It produces similar manhattan and Q-Q plots as the 'manhattan' and 'qq' functions in the 'qqman' package, with the advantage of including extra annotation information and interactive web-based visualizations directly from R. Once uploaded to a 'plotly' account, 'plotly' graphs (and the data behind them) can be viewed and modified in a web browser."
