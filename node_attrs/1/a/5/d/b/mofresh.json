Perfect for refreshing matplotlib plots or any image content.\n  HTMLRefreshWidget - Renders HTML content that can be updated on the fly. Great for Altair charts, plotly visualizations, or custom HTML.\n  ProgressBar - A modern progress bar with dark mode support. Ideal for tracking training loops or long-running operations.\n\nThe trick to get updating charts to work is to leverage anywidget.
